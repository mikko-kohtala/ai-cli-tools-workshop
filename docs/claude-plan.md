# AI CLI Tools for Developers: Workshop Presentation

## Presentation Overview

**Duration:** 25 minutes  
**Audience:** Mixed-level developers  
**Format:** Next.js/React implementation ready

---

## SECTION 1: Introduction to AI CLI Tools (5 minutes)

### Slide 1: Title Slide

**Title:** AI CLI Tools: Your Terminal's New Superpowers

**Content:**

- Workshop for developers at all levels
- From autocomplete to autonomous agents
- Practical guide to terminal-based AI coding

**Speaker Notes:**
Welcome everyone. Today we're exploring AI CLI tools—not the IDE plugins you might know, but powerful terminal-native coding assistants. Over the past year, these tools have evolved from simple autocomplete to autonomous agents that can plan, execute, and test complex multi-file changes. We'll cover what they are, how to use them effectively, when they excel, and critically—when they fail. This is practical knowledge you can apply immediately.

### Slide 2: What are AI CLI tools?

**Title:** Beyond autocomplete: terminal-native AI agents

**Content:**

- **Conversational coding** in your terminal environment
- Integrate LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) directly into CLI
- Accept natural language instructions, not memorized syntax
- Deep integration with codebases, Git, and development tools
- Different from IDE tools: scriptable, composable, Unix-philosophy compliant

**Key Stats:**

- 20M+ developers using GitHub Copilot
- 1M+ developers adopted Gemini CLI in 3 months
- 35K+ GitHub stars for Aider

**Speaker Notes:**
AI CLI tools are fundamentally different from chat interfaces like ChatGPT or IDE plugins like GitHub Copilot's inline suggestions. Think of them as conversational pair programmers living in your terminal. You describe what you want in natural language—"fix the authentication bug and add tests"—and they plan, execute, and validate changes across multiple files. Unlike clicking through UI elements in an IDE, these tools follow Unix principles: composable, scriptable, and designed to integrate into existing terminal workflows. The adoption numbers are staggering—GitHub Copilot alone has 20 million developers, while newer open-source tools like Aider have gained 35,000 GitHub stars. Gemini CLI reached 1 million developers within 3 months of launch.

---

### Slide 3: How they actually work

**Title:** Architecture: from prompt to production code

**Content:**
**Four-Layer Architecture:**

1. **Terminal Interface** - Commands, session management, interactive prompts
2. **LLM Communication** - API calls to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or local models
3. **Context Management** - Codebase indexing, conversation history, project memory
4. **Tool Execution** - File operations, command execution, Git integration, MCP protocol

**Processing Patterns:**

- **Simple:** User prompt → API → Response → Output
- **Agentic:** Planning → Tool Selection → Execution Loop → Validation → Commit

**Speaker Notes:**
Understanding the architecture helps you use these tools effectively. There are four layers: First, the terminal interface handles your input using frameworks like Node.js or Python. Second, the LLM communication layer makes API calls to providers—this is where your prompts go to GPT-4, Claude, or Gemini. Third, context management indexes your codebase and maintains conversation history. Many tools use project files like AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md to remember your coding standards. Fourth, tool execution performs actual operations: editing files, running tests, executing Git commands. Advanced tools use the Model Context Protocol to integrate with external services like GitHub, Slack, or Google Drive. The key difference between simple and agentic patterns: simple tools just answer questions, while agentic tools plan multi-step tasks, select appropriate tools, execute iteratively, and validate results before committing.

### Slide 4: Why developers should care

**Title:** Real productivity gains and workflow transformation

**Content:**
**Measurable Impact:**

- Individual contributors: **5-10x faster** on repetitive tasks
- GitHub Copilot: generates **46% of code** in enabled files
- Junior developers: **21-40%** productivity gains
- Senior developers: **7-16%** gains (diminishing returns on complex work)

**Problems They Solve:**

- Command-line complexity (1000s of tools, different syntax)
- Codebase navigation (Claude: 1M token context = 750K words of code)
- Repetitive engineering tasks (formatting, linting, documentation)
- Testing overhead (automated test generation)
- Debugging cryptic errors

**Speaker Notes:**
The productivity numbers are real but nuanced. For repetitive tasks—boilerplate code, documentation, test generation—you can genuinely be 5 to 10 times faster. GitHub's data shows Copilot generates 46% of code in enabled files. But here's the critical insight: gains vary by experience level. Junior developers see 21-40% improvements because AI excels at routine tasks they're still learning. Senior developers only gain 7-16% because their work involves complex architecture and domain knowledge AI can't replicate. These tools solve specific pain points exceptionally well: you don't need to memorize ffmpeg syntax anymore—just describe what you want. Claude Code can understand 1 million tokens of context, essentially reading 750,000 words of your codebase. Tedious work like fixing linting errors or updating documentation becomes instant. The key is knowing when to use them, which we'll cover extensively.

### Slide 5: Core capabilities across tools

**Title:** What AI CLI tools can do today

**Content:**
**Standard Capabilities:**

- **Code Generation**: From natural language, examples, or patterns
- **Refactoring**: Multi-file updates, style enforcement, modernization
- **Debugging**: Error diagnosis, stack trace analysis, fix suggestions
- **Documentation**: README generation, docstrings, API docs
- **Testing**: Unit test creation, integration tests, test data generation
- **Git Operations**: Automatic commits, PR creation, conflict resolution
- **Codebase Q&A**: "Where is authentication implemented?"

**Advanced Features (2025):**

- Multi-modal inputs (screenshots → code)
- Autonomous agents (plan, execute, validate without constant supervision)
- Tool extensibility via MCP
- Cost tracking and usage monitoring

**Speaker Notes:**
Modern AI CLI tools share a common feature set. For code generation, you can describe functionality in natural language and get working implementations. They handle refactoring across dozens or hundreds of files simultaneously—renaming variables, extracting functions, applying style guides consistently. For debugging, paste an error message and get both an explanation and proposed fix. Documentation generation is particularly strong—tools can create README files, add docstrings to all functions, or generate API documentation from code. Testing is another sweet spot: "generate unit tests for auth.py with 80% coverage" produces comprehensive test suites. Git integration means automatic commits with meaningful messages, branch management, and even pull request generation. You can query your codebase in natural language: "where is authentication implemented?" Tools introduced in 2025 support multi-modal inputs—upload a UI screenshot and get React code. The most advanced feature is true autonomy: give Claude Code a complex task and it will plan multiple steps, execute them, run tests, debug failures, and iterate until completion—all while you work on something else.

## SECTION 2: Best Practices (5 minutes)

### Slide 6: Effective prompting techniques

**Title:** The art of getting what you want

**Content:**
**Four Core Strategies:**

1. **Q&A Strategy** - Force clarification first

   - ❌ "Help me create a user authentication system"
   - ✅ "Before providing a solution, ask me questions about my specific requirements"

2. **Role-Based Prompting** - Assume expert perspective

   - ✅ "Act as a senior security engineer with 10 years experience. Review this code for OWASP vulnerabilities."

3. **Stepwise Chain of Thought** - Maintain control

   - ✅ "Help me refactor service.js. Go one step at a time. Wait for 'next' before proceeding."

4. **Pros and Cons** - Balanced assessment
   - ✅ "Analyze pros and cons of MongoDB vs PostgreSQL for a product catalog. Consider scalability, queries, development ease."

**Speaker Notes:**
Prompt quality directly determines output quality. Let's examine four battle-tested strategies. First, the Q&A strategy prevents the most common failure: AI rushing to generic solutions. Instead of "help me build auth," say "before providing a solution, ask me relevant questions." This forces the AI to gather context first. Second, role-based prompting focuses responses toward specific expertise. "Act as a senior security engineer" makes the AI emphasize security vulnerabilities and OWASP risks it might otherwise overlook. This is especially valuable when your team lacks certain specialists. Third, stepwise prompting prevents compounding errors. Complex refactoring done all at once can go sideways fast. "Go one step at a time, wait for 'next'" lets you validate each change before proceeding. Fourth, the pros and cons strategy prevents one-sided recommendations. Instead of "what database should I use," ask for comparative analysis with specific factors. This reveals trade-offs you might not have considered. Combine these strategies: "Act as a DevOps engineer. Ask me questions about our infrastructure, then provide a step-by-step plan with pros and cons for each approach."

---

### Slide 7: Context management and project setup

**Title:** Teaching AI about your codebase

**Content:**
**Project Definition Files:**

```markdown
# AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md / GEMINI.md

- Language: Python 3.11+
- Framework: FastAPI
- Test Command: pytest tests/
- Style: Black formatter, type hints required
- Never modify: config/production.yaml
- Core patterns: Use repository pattern for data access
```

**Best Practices:**

- Create project-specific instruction files in repository root
- Define coding standards, test commands, style guides
- Specify files that should never be modified
- Document architectural patterns to follow
- Use `@file`, `@folder`, `@url` syntax where supported
- Set explicit constraints (performance requirements, language/framework, security needs)

**Speaker Notes:**
Context is everything with AI tools. The single most effective technique is creating project definition files. Most tools support AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, or GEMINI.md files in your project root. These files teach the AI about your specific project. Include your language version, framework, how to run tests, style guidelines, and most importantly—architectural patterns you follow and files that should never be touched. For example, specify "use repository pattern for data access" so the AI doesn't randomly put database queries in controllers. When supported, use specific context markers like @auth/router.py to reference files. Always set explicit constraints in your prompts: "optimized for numbers up to 10,000," "must be thread-safe," "Python function using NumPy." Without constraints, AI makes assumptions that may not align with your needs. Think of these files as onboarding documentation for a new team member—because that's exactly what the AI is.

### Slide 8: Workflow integration strategies

**Title:** Making AI CLI tools part of your development process

**Content:**
**Git Integration Pattern:**

1. Create feature branch via CLI tool
2. Let AI make incremental changes with auto-commits
3. Review all commits in aggregate
4. Clean up commit history (git rebase -i)
5. Push for human review

**CI/CD Integration:**

- Automated test generation for uncovered code
- AI code review before human review
- Documentation updates based on code changes
- **Security Requirements:**
  - ✅ Use masked CI/CD variables for API keys
  - ✅ Enforce branch protection
  - ✅ Require human approval for production

**IDE + CLI Simultaneous Use:**

- Terminal: Commands and automation
- IDE: Visual code review and editing
- Launch shortcuts (Cmd+Esc for Claude Code)

**Speaker Notes:**
Effective integration requires thoughtful workflow design. For Git, the pattern that works best is: let the AI create a feature branch and make incremental commits as it works, then you review all commits together. AI commits can be noisy, so use git rebase -i to consolidate them into clean, logical commits before creating your PR. Never push AI commits directly to main. For CI/CD, you can integrate AI tools into pipelines for specific tasks: generate tests for code that lacks coverage, perform automated code review to catch obvious issues before human review, or auto-update documentation when code changes. Critical security requirement: always use masked variables for API keys, never commit them. Enforce branch protection so AI changes go through merge requests requiring human approval. Many developers successfully use both IDE and CLI tools simultaneously: Claude Code or Aider in the terminal for automation and bulk operations, Cursor or VS Code for visual editing and precise changes. Claude Code even supports instant launch with Cmd+Esc from your IDE. The key is choosing the right tool for each task rather than forcing one tool for everything.

### Slide 9: When to use (and when not to use)

**Title:** Decision framework for AI CLI tools

**Content:**
**✅ Excellent Use Cases (High ROI):**

- MVP and rapid prototyping (70% completion very quickly)
- Boilerplate and CRUD operations (30-50% time savings)
- Documentation and comments (60-80% time savings)
- Test generation with TDD workflows
- Large codebase understanding and onboarding
- Refactoring and code cleanup
- CLI scripts and automation

**❌ When NOT to Use:**

- Complex architectural decisions (requires deep domain knowledge)
- Production-critical code without review (**40% contains vulnerabilities**)
- When you lack expertise to validate output ("70% problem")
- Context-heavy tasks (65% report AI misses critical context)
- Security-sensitive code (needs security expert review)
- When cost exceeds value ($3-5/hour can accumulate)
- Fully autonomous workflows (needs guidance and course-correction)

**Speaker Notes:**
This decision framework will save you time and frustration. AI CLI tools excel at MVPs and prototypes because speed matters more than perfection—you can get to 70% completion incredibly fast. Boilerplate, CRUD operations, and repetitive code are perfect because AI has seen these patterns millions of times. Documentation is a particularly strong use case with 60-80% time savings—tools can generate READMEs, add docstrings, create API docs from code. Test generation works well, especially with tools like Cline that execute tests and iterate on failures. For understanding large unfamiliar codebases, AI with large context windows can analyze entire projects and answer "where is X implemented?" Now the critical part—when NOT to use: Don't rely on AI for complex architectural decisions requiring domain knowledge and long-term thinking. Never deploy production-critical code without thorough review—research shows 40% of AI-generated code contains vulnerabilities. The "70% problem" is real: if you lack expertise to validate output, you'll get stuck at 70% completion unable to debug the remaining 30%. Context-heavy tasks are problematic—65% of developers report AI misses critical context during refactoring. Security-sensitive code requires security expert review even if you prompt for secure practices. Watch costs carefully: Claude Code runs $3-5 per hour, which accumulates quickly. Finally, avoid fully autonomous workflows—AI needs guidance and course-correction to avoid repeating mistakes.

## SECTION 3: Real-World Use Cases (5 minutes)

### Slide 10: Code generation scenarios

**Title:** From idea to implementation in minutes

**Content:**
**Building APIs and Web Applications:**

- Flask app with multiple endpoints from natural language
- RESTful APIs with CRUD operations
- Full-stack prototypes from Figma designs (hours vs days)
- **Real Example**: Fitness tracker dashboard with Chart.js integration
  - Interactive bar/line/pie charts
  - Real-time updates and local storage
  - Weekly summary calculations
  - Working responsive UI

**Boilerplate and Scaffolding:**

- Project structures and configuration files
- Dependency setup and verification
- Standardized code patterns across polyglot codebases
- Database schemas and migrations

**Speaker Notes:**
Let's look at concrete examples. For building APIs, developers successfully use tools like Aider and Claude Code to generate complete Flask or Express applications from prompts like "create a REST API with CRUD endpoints for users." A real example: GitHub Copilot CLI recently created a complete fitness tracker dashboard with Chart.js integration—interactive charts, real-time updates, local storage persistence, and weekly summary calculations—all from a natural language description. The resulting code was responsive and production-ready after minimal tweaking. This kind of work used to take hours; AI does it in minutes. For boilerplate and scaffolding, AI excels at generating project structures, configuration files like package.json or requirements.txt, setting up dependencies, and creating standardized patterns. If you're working in a polyglot codebase—say, Python backend and React frontend—AI can maintain consistent patterns across both. Database schema generation and migration scripts are another strong use case. The key insight: AI is best for work that follows established patterns where there are millions of examples in the training data.

### Slide 11: Refactoring, debugging, and testing

**Title:** Maintenance work made manageable

**Content:**
**Refactoring Examples:**

- Style enforcement: Apply PEP8, ESLint rules across entire codebase
- Breaking up long methods, avoiding nested logic
- Renaming variables consistently across multiple files
- Modernizing deprecated syntax
- Migration between frameworks

**Debugging Workflows:**

- "Find process using port 8080, kill it, verify port is free" (single command)
- Merge conflict resolution
- Error log interpretation and fix suggestions
- Test-driven development (Cline specialty)

**Test Generation:**

- Unit tests for specific functions with edge cases
- Integration test scaffolding
- Test data and fixture creation
- 80%+ coverage generation from single prompt

**Real Data:**

- GitHub Copilot: 55% faster code writing
- Teams: 11 weeks average to fully realize benefits

**Speaker Notes:**
Maintenance work is where AI CLI tools provide consistent value. For refactoring, you can apply coding standards across entire codebases with prompts like "apply PEP8 formatting to all Python files" or "break up long methods in service.js." These tools excel at renaming variables consistently across multiple files—a tedious, error-prone task when done manually. Migration between frameworks or modernizing deprecated syntax becomes manageable. One developer used Aider to migrate an entire Pester v4 codebase to v5. For debugging, AI interprets cryptic error messages and suggests fixes. You can paste stack traces and get explanations plus proposed solutions. Simple but powerful examples: "find what process is using port 8080, kill it, and verify the port is free" executes as a single natural language command. Cline specializes in test-driven development—it writes tests, generates code to pass them, executes the suite, catches failures, and iterates until all tests pass. For test generation generally, prompt "generate unit tests for auth.py with 80% coverage" and get comprehensive test suites with edge cases, proper mocking, and fixtures. Real data confirms this: GitHub reports 55% faster code writing with Copilot. However, teams need an average of 11 weeks to fully realize benefits as they learn effective prompting and integration patterns.

### Slide 12: Documentation and Git operations

**Title:** Automating the tasks developers procrastinate on

**Content:**
**Documentation Generation:**

- README files with installation and usage instructions
- Inline docstrings for all functions
- API reference documentation from code
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Release notes from Git history

**Git and Version Control:**

```bash
# Commit message from diff
git diff HEAD | llm "write conventional commit message"

# Stage, commit, and create PR (single command)
"Stage changes, write commit referencing #1234, open draft PR"

# Resolve merge conflicts
"Resolve merge conflicts in feature branch"
```

**Other Automation:**

- Finding and ranking good first issues
- Explaining project architecture to new developers
- CI/CD integration for automated workflows
- Release management and changelog generation

**Speaker Notes:**
Documentation is the task developers love to hate—and where AI provides some of the highest time savings. Tools can automatically generate README files with proper installation steps, usage examples, and API documentation. You can prompt "add docstrings to all functions in api.py" and get comprehensive inline documentation following your preferred format—Google style, Sphinx, JSDoc, whatever you specify. API reference documentation can be generated from code structure or OpenAPI specs. Release notes are another strong use case: pipe your Git history to an AI and get formatted release notes grouped by features, bug fixes, and breaking changes. For Git operations, this is a game-changer. Instead of carefully crafting commit messages, pipe your diff to an AI: "git diff HEAD | llm 'write conventional commit message'" and get properly formatted commits. Complex Git workflows become single natural language commands: "stage changes, write a commit referencing issue #1234, and open a draft PR." Merge conflict resolution goes from frustrating to straightforward—AI can analyze both branches and propose resolutions. Other practical automation includes finding good first issues in repositories and ranking them by difficulty, explaining project architecture to new team members, CI/CD integration for automated workflows, and release management. These are tasks that must be done but don't require deep architectural thinking—perfect for AI.

## SECTION 4: Common Pitfalls and Limitations (4 minutes)

### Slide 13: The pitfalls of over-reliance

**Title:** When AI becomes a crutch instead of a tool

**Content:**
**The "70% Problem":**

- Non-engineers and beginners can get 70% of the way quickly
- The final 30% becomes an exercise in diminishing returns
- Requires understanding to debug what's wrong
- Creates dependency loop: keep going back to AI instead of learning

**Blind Trust in Outputs:**

- Perry et al. (2023): Users trust AI-generated code MORE than their own
- Inexperienced developers accept advice as "gospel truth"
- Problem spirals: AI fixes often create bigger problems

**Skills Erosion:**

- Over-reliance limits creative problem-solving capacity
- Loss of familiarity with secure coding patterns
- **Parallel**: 52% of British parents can't do times tables (calculator dependency)
- When code "just appears," developers don't learn underlying principles

**Stack Overflow 2024:**

- Only 16.3% say AI made them "more productive to a great extent"
- 41.4% say "little or no effect"
- 30% aren't using AI tools and don't plan to start

**Speaker Notes:**
Over-reliance on AI is the single biggest trap. Let's talk about the "70% problem": beginners and non-engineers can get to 70% completion incredibly fast with AI—it feels magical. But the final 30% becomes an exercise in frustration because they lack the mental models to understand what's going wrong. They end up in a dependency loop, constantly going back to the AI for fixes that often create bigger problems. Research by Perry and colleagues found something alarming: users trust AI-generated code MORE than code they write themselves. Inexperienced developers treat AI suggestions as gospel truth, accepting them without critical review. This leads to cascading failures—when AI fixes a problem, it often introduces new, subtler bugs that compound over time. There's genuine concern about skills erosion. Over-reliance limits creative problem-solving capacity and developers lose familiarity with secure coding patterns. The parallel to calculator dependency is instructive: 52% of British parents can't do times tables anymore. When code just appears without you thinking through the problem, you don't learn underlying principles. The 2024 Stack Overflow survey provides sobering context: despite the hype, only 16% say AI made them significantly more productive; 41% report little or no effect; and 30% of developers aren't using AI tools and don't plan to. The message: AI is a powerful tool but not a replacement for fundamental skills.

### Slide 14: Code quality and technical debt

**Title:** The hidden costs of AI-generated code

**Content:**
**GitClear 2025 Study** (153M lines analyzed):

- Code churn expected to **DOUBLE** in 2024
- **7%+** of all code changes reverted within two weeks (up from 3-4% pre-2023)
- **8x increase** in duplicated code blocks
- **17% year-over-year decrease** in moved/reused code

**Root Causes:**

- AI generates new code from scratch rather than refactoring existing code
- Copy/paste suggestions create "short-term developer" patterns
- Missing opportunities for abstraction and modular design
- Verbose or inefficient code adds to technical debt
- Poor error handling and logging
- Inconsistent code quality without project-specific context

**Cost Implications:**

- More time fixing AI code than writing manually (red flag)
- Maintenance burden increases with code bloat
- Architectural drift: subtle design changes break security invariants

**Speaker Notes:**
Here's a troubling trend backed by hard data. GitClear analyzed 153 million lines of code and found that code churn is expected to DOUBLE in 2024 compared to pre-AI baselines. Code churn means changes that get reverted—a proxy for mistakes. Seven percent of all code changes are now reverted within two weeks, up from 3-4% before 2023. Even more concerning: an 8x increase in duplicated code blocks and a 17% decrease in code reuse. What's happening? AI generates new code from scratch rather than refactoring or reusing existing code. It encourages copy/paste patterns that don't integrate thoughtfully with the codebase. AI misses opportunities for abstraction—it doesn't think "this logic exists elsewhere, let me reuse it." The result is verbose, bloated code that adds to technical debt. Other quality issues: poor error handling, missing logging, and inconsistent patterns when AI doesn't follow project-specific conventions. The cost implications are real: when you spend more time fixing AI code than writing it yourself, you've crossed a red flag threshold. Maintenance burden increases as code bloat accumulates. Architectural drift occurs when subtle AI-suggested design changes break security invariants or established patterns. The lesson: AI is optimized for speed of initial generation, not long-term maintainability. You need strong review processes to prevent technical debt accumulation.

### Slide 15: Security vulnerabilities and limitations

**Title:** The 40% problem: why AI-generated code needs scrutiny

**Content:**
**Vulnerability Statistics:**

- **45%** of AI-generated code contains security vulnerabilities (Veracode 2025)
- **Georgetown CSET**: Almost **50%** of code snippets contain impactful bugs
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: 86% failure rate (only 14% secure)
- **Log Injection**: 88% failure rate
- **Java Code**: 71% security failure rate (highest risk)
- **GitHub repos with Copilot**: 6.4% secret leak rate vs 4.6% without

**Most Common Flaws:**

- Missing input sanitization (most common flaw)
- No authentication/authorization checks
- Hard-coded secrets and credentials
- Unsafe functions (eval, exec) without validation
- Outdated dependencies with known CVEs

**Critical Insight:**

- Security performance has NOT improved despite models getting better at syntax
- Newer/larger models don't generate more secure code than predecessors

**Speaker Notes:**
This is the most critical slide in the presentation. Let me be direct: 45% of AI-generated code contains security vulnerabilities according to Veracode's 2025 report analyzing over 100 LLMs. Georgetown's Center for Security and Emerging Technology found almost 50% of code snippets contain impactful bugs. The vulnerability-specific data is alarming: 86% failure rate for Cross-Site Scripting protection—only 14% of AI-generated code properly prevents XSS attacks. Log injection has an 88% failure rate. Java code has a 71% security failure rate, making it the highest risk language. GitHub repositories using Copilot have a 6.4% secret leak rate compared to 4.6% for repos without AI tools. The most common flaw across all models and languages is missing input sanitization. AI consistently generates code that doesn't validate user input, leaving systems vulnerable to injection attacks. Even when explicitly prompted to "write secure code," models apply inconsistent checks. Other patterns: no authentication or authorization checks, hard-coded secrets in code, unsafe function usage, and suggesting outdated dependencies with known CVEs patched after the model's training cutoff. Here's the most troubling finding: security performance has NOT improved despite models getting better at generating syntactically correct code. Newer, larger models don't generate significantly more secure code than predecessors. Why? They're trained on public repositories containing both secure and vulnerable code, learning patterns without understanding security intent. The takeaway: never deploy AI-generated code without thorough security review.

---

### Slide 16: What AI CLI tools cannot do

**Title:** Understanding the boundaries

**Content:**
**Cannot Handle Well:**

- Complex architectural decisions and system design
- Context understanding: **65%** report AI misses critical context during refactoring
- Performance optimization (can introduce regressions)
- Security vulnerability identification without explicit prompting
- Compliance and regulatory requirements (GDPR, CCPA)
- Novel solutions that haven't been seen before
- Domain expertise in particular industries

**Research Finding:**

- **METR Study (July 2025)**: Experienced developers using AI were **19% SLOWER** despite believing they were faster
- AI introduced **41% more bugs**
- **Developer perception vs reality**: Believe they're 20% faster when actually slower

**Technical Constraints:**

- Knowledge cutoff dates (lacks awareness of new patterns)
- Hallucinations: invents non-existent packages ("slopsquatting")
- No runtime verification or type checking
- Context window limits even with 1M tokens

**Speaker Notes:**
Understanding what AI cannot do is as important as knowing its strengths. AI struggles with complex architectural decisions requiring holistic system design and understanding of business logic trade-offs. Sixty-five percent of developers report AI misses critical context during refactoring—it operates on code blocks in isolation without the big picture. It cannot anticipate performance bottlenecks and can actually introduce performance regressions. Security vulnerability identification requires explicit prompting; AI doesn't inherently understand cryptographic principles or attack surfaces. Compliance with regulations like GDPR or CCPA is beyond its capability—it lacks understanding of legal requirements. For novel solutions that haven't appeared in training data, AI is limited. Domain expertise in specialized industries is absent. Now for the most surprising finding: a July 2025 METR study showed experienced developers using AI were 19% SLOWER and introduced 41% more bugs. Yet developers believed they were 20% faster—this is a perception problem caused by the dopamine hit of seeing code appear quickly, even though the overall process including debugging takes longer. Technical constraints include knowledge cutoff dates that leave AI unaware of new patterns, hallucinations where it invents non-existent packages, no runtime verification or type checking, and effectiveness degradation even with massive context windows. The lesson: AI is a junior developer who needs constant supervision, not a senior architect.

## SECTION 5: Tool Comparison (5 minutes)

### Slide 17: GitHub Copilot / Copilot CLI

**Title:** The most widely adopted AI coding assistant

**Content:**
**Core Features:**

- 20M+ developers, 3 billion code suggestions accepted
- CLI agent with natural language commands (September 2025)
- GitHub-aware: reads issues, PRs, repos
- Multi-model: GPT-4.1, GPT-5, o3, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 2.5, Grok
- IDE integration: VS Code, JetBrains, Vim, Visual Studio

**Pricing (2025 Five-Tier System):**

1. **Free**: $0 - 2K completions/month, 50 premium requests
2. **Pro**: $10/month - Unlimited completions, 300 premium requests, CLI access
3. **Pro+**: $39/month - 1,500 premium requests (5x Pro)
4. **Business**: $19/user/month - Centralized management
5. **Enterprise**: $39/user/month - Custom models, knowledge bases

**Strengths:** Best GitHub integration, excellent value at $10/month, wide IDE support, multiple frontier models

**Weaknesses:** Limited context (vs competitors), CLI features newer/less mature, pricing complexity

**Best For:** Developers in GitHub ecosystem, budget-conscious individuals, teams needing centralized management

**Speaker Notes:**
GitHub Copilot is the 800-pound gorilla with 20 million developers and 3 billion accepted code suggestions. In September 2025, they launched Copilot CLI bringing agent capabilities to the terminal—natural language commands for file editing, command execution, and commit creation. It's GitHub-aware, meaning it can read issues, PRs, and repository context. You can switch between multiple models: GPT-4.1, GPT-5, o3, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 2.5, and even Grok. IDE integration is comprehensive: VS Code, JetBrains suite, Vim, Visual Studio, Eclipse, Xcode. The 2025 pricing overhaul introduced five tiers. The Free tier gives 2,000 completions and 50 premium requests per month—good for trying it out. Pro at $10/month is the sweet spot: unlimited completions, 300 premium requests, and CLI access. Pro+ at $39/month offers 5x more premium requests for power users. Business and Enterprise tiers add centralized management, IP indemnity, custom models, and knowledge bases. Strengths: Best-in-class GitHub integration, excellent value at $10/month, continuous model updates, and massive user base providing stability.

**Speaker Notes:**
Cursor is the AI-first code editor that raised $900 million at a $9.9 billion valuation in 2025. It's a fork of VS Code, so the interface is familiar, but redesigned around AI. The Agent mode—formerly called Composer—provides multi-file autonomous editing: describe what you want and watch it modify multiple files simultaneously. Tab completion offers predictive autocomplete, and the chat interface is context-aware about your entire codebase. You can switch between Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-4o, GPT-5, o1, Gemini models. Cursor Rules via .cursorrules files let you define project-specific instructions. Background Agents can execute tasks remotely while you work on other things. The pricing model shifted to credits in June 2025, causing community backlash due to confusion. Free tier offers a 2-week Pro trial with limited usage. Pro at $20/month gives unlimited Tab completions and $20 in usage credits—credits are consumed based on model and tokens used. Pro+ at $60/month is recommended for regular users with 3x more credits. Ultra at $200/month is for heavy professional use with $400 in credits—20x more than Pro. Teams and Enterprise add centralized billing, analytics, and controls. Strengths: familiar interface with low learning curve, powerful Agent mode for complex tasks, excellent context understanding, and real-time diff visualization. Weaknesses: credit system is confusing and unpredictable, costs can accumulate quickly—$60-200/month for regular use, and it depends entirely on third-party models with no proprietary advantage. Best for rapid prototyping and building MVPs, multi-file refactoring across large codebases, developers willing to leave traditional editors for AI-first experience, and visual/UI development work.

## SECTION 6: Conclusion (1 minute)

### Slide 22: Key takeaways and recommendations

**Title:** AI CLI tools: amplifiers, not replacements

**Content:**
**The Reality:**

- ✅ **20-50% productivity gains** for specific tasks (boilerplate, docs, tests)
- ✅ **Junior developers**: 21-40% gains on routine tasks
- ❌ **Senior developers**: Only 7-16% gains on complex work
- ⚠️ **Overall**: METR study shows experienced devs 19% SLOWER (but believe they're faster)

**Essential Principles:**

1. **"Trust but Verify"** - AI is a junior developer needing supervision
2. **Right Tool, Right Task** - Excel at MVPs, boilerplate, docs; struggle with architecture, security
3. **Security First** - 45% of AI code contains vulnerabilities; always review
4. **Cost Awareness** - Monitor spending ($3-5/hour adds up quickly)
5. **Context is King** - Use AGENTS.md files and explicit prompting
6. **Continuous Learning** - Tools improve weekly; stay current
7. **Human Judgment** - Keep humans in the loop for critical decisions

**Getting Started:**

- Week 1-4: Start small (docs, boilerplate only)
- Week 5-8: Expand to Git workflows, testing
- Week 9-12: Optimize costs, refine prompting
- Average: 11 weeks to realize full benefits

**Final Thought:** AI suggests; you decide. These tools amplify your expertise—they don't replace it.

**Speaker Notes:**
Let's wrap up with essential takeaways. The reality is nuanced: you can achieve 20-50% productivity gains for specific tasks like boilerplate, documentation, and test generation. Junior developers see 21-40% gains because AI excels at routine tasks they're learning. Senior developers only gain 7-16% because their work involves complex architecture AI can't replicate. Surprisingly, the METR study showed experienced developers were actually 19% slower using AI, despite believing they were faster—the dopamine hit of seeing code appear masks the time spent debugging. Essential principles: First, "trust but verify"—treat AI as a junior developer requiring constant supervision. Second, use the right tool for the right task: AI excels at MVPs, boilerplate, and documentation; it struggles with architecture and security. Third, security first: 45% of AI-generated code contains vulnerabilities, so always review before deployment. Fourth, cost awareness: $3-5 per hour accumulates quickly without monitoring. Fifth, context is king: use AGENTS.md files and explicit prompting to teach AI about your project. Sixth, continuous learning: these tools improve weekly with new models and features. Seventh, human judgment: keep humans in the loop for critical decisions. For getting started, follow a phased approach: weeks 1-4, start small using AI only for docs and boilerplate; weeks 5-8, expand to Git workflows and testing; weeks 9-12, optimize costs and refine prompting. Teams need an average of 11 weeks to realize full benefits. Final thought: AI suggests; you decide. These tools amplify your expertise—they don't replace it. Successful developers combine AI speed with human judgment, using AI as a force multiplier rather than a crutch.
