This repository will be a repo for "AI CLI Tools Workshop". I will have a around 25min presentation, and then we a going to have 1 hour workshop where people will complete workshop tasks. Times are estimates.

URL will be: https://ai-cli-tools-workshop.vercel.app

Lets start by cleaning up CLAUDE.md. I will be using lots of Claude Code and Codex CLI, so lets keep CLAUDE.md brief and it should give short information about the repo and what we are going to do.

There will be TODO.md, which will track our progress. Can you add placeholders for the different things we need to do.

- Build the app platform. Page for presentation, and pages for different tasks.
- We will need to do clean presentation about the AI CLI Tools
- We need around 4 tasks which users are tasked to do with Codex CLI.

Our main focus is on Codex CLI, because that is available for our organization.

‚ÄúCodex CLI is a coding agent that you can run locally from your terminal and that can read, modify, and run code on your machine, in the chosen directory.¬†Build by OpenAI.‚Äú

Here is the invitation I already sent:

```
Join us to explore the world of¬†AI Command Line tools¬†‚Äî how to get started, use them effectively, and bring a little AI vibe to your developer workflow. This session is open to everyone interested in the topic.

The workshop will have two parts: a presentation introducing the landscape of AI CLI tools and hands-on exercises you can start working on right after.

Our main focus will be on¬†OpenAI‚Äôs Codex CLI, which is available through our existing OpenAI ChatGPT licensing. There are also several other AI CLI tools you can try if you have access ‚Äî such as Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Amp Code, or Opencode. It‚Äôs recommended to set up Codex CLI in advance of the workshop. Detailed setup instructions will be shared soon.You can also get started here:¬†https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli

When: 28.10.2025, 14:00‚Äì15:30
Where: Teams, Tampere office, and most likely the Helsinki office as well
Slack:¬†#ai-guild¬†channel

Both the presentation and workshop materials will be published closer to the event.

üí° Note: Guild participation counts as¬†billable hours¬†by default (unless agreed otherwise with your Delivery Lead). If not, please book your time under "Competence Development / Guilds".

‚ö†Ô∏è Reminder: Use AI tools responsibly, especially in project work. Please first review the Knowit AI and data policies available in SharePoint.

You have access to /Users/mikkoh/code/mikko/react-19-workshop which is similarly structured workshop. We will be using same tooling: next.js, tailwind with shadcn
components, sidebar and so on. We will be keeping the simple and clean ui styles.
